The system should be running on what ports?

8661 and 8662 which are currently unassigned according to IANA

8661 for SSL Socket access
8662 for SSL Websocket

https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt

8616-8664            Unassigned

However, there are other ports, Private/Dynamic Port Numbers

49,152 to 65,535

These ports are neither reserved nor maintained by IANA. They can be used for any purpose without registration, so they are appropriate for a private protocol used only by a particular organization

Opted to use the class of ports in the "Registered (User) Port Numbers" range since I'd like to keep it standard.
